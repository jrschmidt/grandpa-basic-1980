Programming 1980 style!! The way we did it in the old days. Using an HTML5
canvas element and Coffeescript, this project emulates an old fashioned
line-numbered BASIC language machine. On a monochrome monitor, of course,
and only upper case letters. Green, or amber if you want to get fancy with
third party equipment.
